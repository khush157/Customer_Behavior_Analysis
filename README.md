# Customer_Behavior_Analysis Dashboard (Python + Power BI + SQL)
# Overview

This project aims to analyse and visualise Customer Shopping Behavior data from a public dataset of a Customer Shopping Behavior , using Python Pandas for data cleaning, SQL for extract data and Power BI for visualisations and interactive dashboard reporting.

The goal was to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills including:
- Data cleaning using Python Pandas
- Exploratory SQL analysis
- Visual storytelling with Power BI
- DAX powered interactive elements

# Project Objective

To analyse Customer Behavior data from a  store and build an insightful dashboard that highlights key business performance indicators such as:
- *Revenue trends* across time
- *Top-selling items* on categories
- *Average items per Order*
- Percentage of Sales by Categories
